 * Prefix of Next.js internal middleware control headers.

 * When an upstream provider is itself hosted behind a Next.js middleware
 * (e.g. synthetic.new), a perfectly successful `200 OK` response can still
 * carry Next's own control headers such as `x-middleware-rewrite`,
 * `x-middleware-next`, `x-middleware-override-headers`,
 * `x-middleware-set-cookie`, and the `x-middleware-request-*` family.
 *
 * OmniRoute forwards upstream response headers verbatim. If we re-emit those
 * headers from an App Router route handler, Next 16's `app-route` runtime
 * interprets `x-middleware-rewrite` as a `NextResponse.rewrite()` call and
 * throws `NextResponse.rewrite() was used in a app route handler` — turning a
 * successful upstream call into a 500. This is provider-agnostic proxy
 * hygiene: any upstream behind Next middleware can leak these headers.

 * See issue #5849.
